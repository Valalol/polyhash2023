#CodingRules.txt is a test at establishing a consensus on commentary formatting

Each class/ function must have a commentary section formatted as follows:

"""
{description of the class} / {description of a function} 

Attributes:
    attribute1: attribute_type = {description of the atribute}
    attribute2: ...

Assertions:
    {description of first asssertion}
    ...

"""

{description of the class} should look like: the class represents ...
{description of a function} shoud look like: require(self, arg1, ...) = the function does ...

To note:
description of a function should always be at the same place as the function for simplicity of modification.
description of attributes should not include their type as it should be changeable and can already be found in the __init__ of a class or in the function args.

Other:
If you find yourself using a variable/variable_format many times whilst it's naming not being explicit please register it in CodingReferences.
