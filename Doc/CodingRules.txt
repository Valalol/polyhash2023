#CodingRules.txt is a test at establishing a consensus on commentary formatting

Each class must have a commentary section formatted as follows:

"""
{description of the class}

Attributes:
    attribute1 = {description of the attribute}
    ...

Raises:
    {description of first Raise}
    ...

"""

{description of the class} should look like: the class represents ...

Each function should have a commentary formatted as follows:

"""
{description of a function}

Args:
    Arg1: description of the first argument
    ...

Returns:
    description of what it returns

"""

{description of a function} shoud look like: the function does ...


To note:
description of a function should always be at the same place as the function because: 
Comments that arenâ€™t near their describing code are frustrating to the reader and easily missed when updates are made.

*description of attributes should not include their type because we use type hinting in the __init__ method.
We assume the reader of the code has a basic understanding of programming principles and language syntax.*
type can be used because of commands accessing the function's commmentary section whilst not accessing it's __init__ method


Other:
If you find yourself using a variable/variable_format many times whilst it's naming not being explicit please register it in CodingReferences.
